# Compound Types

## Structs

A `struct` groups and names data of different types.

## Definition

```rust []
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
```

Note:

The fields may not be laid out in memory in the order they are written (unless
you ask the compiler to [ensure that they are](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/other-reprs.html#reprc)).

## Construction

- there is no partial initialization

```rust [1-4|6-8]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
}
```

## Tuples

- Holds values of different types together.
- Like an anonymous `struct`, with fields numbered 0, 1, etc.

```rust [2|3-4]
fn main() {
    let p = (1, 2);
    println!("{}", p.0);
    println!("{}", p.1);
}
```

## `()`

- the *empty tuple*
- represents the absence of data
- we often use this similarly to how youâ€™d use `void` in C

```rust
fn prints_but_returns_nothing(data: &str) -> () {
    println!("passed string: {}", data);
}
```

## Tuple Structs

- Like a `struct`, with fields numbered 0, 1, etc.

```rust [1|4|5-6]
struct Point(i32,i32);

fn main() {
    let p = Point(1, 2);
    println!("{}", p.0);
    println!("{}", p.1);
}
```

## Enums

- An `enum` represents different variations of the same subject.
- The different choices in an enum are called *variants*

<!--
-   stress that enums are an "either or" type: you can only have one
    variant at a time (youâ€™re not accumulating data as with structs)
-   stress that you can only have the variants, not the enum itself
    (i.e. `Movement::Left`. but not `Movement`)
-->

## enum: Definition and Construction

```rust [1-6|9]
enum Shape {
    Square,
    Circle,
    Rectangle,
    Triangle,
}

fn main() {
    let shape = Shape::Rectangle;
}
```

## Enums with Values

```rust [1-6|2-4|5|9|10]
enum Movement {
    Right(i32),
    Left(i32),
    Up(i32),
    Down { speed: i32, excitement: u8 },
}

fn main() {
    let movement = Movement::Left(12);
    let movement = Movement::Down { speed: 12, excitement: 5 };
}
```

## Enums with Values

- An enum value is the same size, no matter which variant is picked
- It will be the size of the largest variant (plus a tag)

Note:

The tag in an enum specifies which variant is currently valid, and is stored as the
smallest integer the compiler can get away with - it depends how many variants you
have. Of course, if none of the variants have any data, the enum is *just* the tag.

If you have a C background, you can think of this as being a `struct` containing an `int`
and a `union`.

## Doing a `match` on an `enum`

- When an `enum` has variants, you use `match` to extract the data
- New variables are created from the *pattern* (e.g. `radius`)

```rust [1-4|7-14|8|11]
enum Shape {
    Circle(i32),
    Rectangle(i32, i32),
}

fn check_shape(shape: Shape) {
    match shape {
        Shape::Circle(radius) => {
            println!("It's a circle, with radius {}", radius);
        }
        _ => {
            println!("Try a circle instead");
        }
    }
}
```

## Doing a `match` on an `enum`

- There are two variables called `radius`
- The binding of `radius` in the pattern on line 9 hides the `radius` variable on line 7

```rust [7|9]
enum Shape {
    Circle(i32),
    Rectangle(i32, i32),
}

fn check_shape(shape: Shape) {
    let radius = 10;
    match shape {
        Shape::Circle(radius) => {
            println!("It's a circle, with radius {}", radius);
        }
        _ => {
            println!("Try a circle instead");
        }
    }
}
```

## Match guards

Match guards allow further refining of a `match`

```rust [8]
enum Shape {
    Circle(i32),
    Rectangle(i32, i32),
}

fn check_shape(shape: Shape) {
    match shape {
        Shape::Circle(radius) if radius > 10 => {
            println!("It's a BIG circle, with radius {}", radius);
        }
        _ => {
            println!("Try a big circle instead");
        }
    }
}
```

## Combining patterns

- You can use the `|` operator to join patterns together

```rust [1-16|9]
enum Shape {
    Circle(i32),
    Rectangle(i32, i32),
    Square(i32),
}

fn test_shape(shape: Shape) {
    match shape {
        Shape::Circle(size) | Shape::Square(size) => {
            println!("Shape has single size field {}", size);
        }
        _ => {
            println!("Not a circle, nor a square");
        }
    }
}
```

## Shorthand: `if let` conditionals

- You can use `if let` if only one case is of interest.
- Still *pattern matching*

```rust []
enum Shape {
    Circle(i32),
    Rectangle(i32, i32),
}

fn test_shape(shape: Shape) {
    if let Shape::Circle(radius) = shape {
        println!("Shape is a Circle with radius {}", radius);
    }
}
```

## Shorthand: `let else` conditionals

- If you expect it to match, but want to handle the error...
- The `else` block must *diverge*

```rust []
enum Shape {
    Circle(i32),
    Rectangle(i32, i32),
}

fn test_shape(shape: Shape) {
    let Shape::Circle(radius) = shape else {
        println!("I only like circles");
        return;
    };
    println!("Shape is a Circle with radius {}", radius);
}
```

## Shorthand: `while let` conditionals

- Keep looping whilst the pattern still matches

```rust should_panic []
enum Shape {
    Circle(i32),
    Rectangle(i32, i32),
}

fn main() {
    while let Shape::Circle(radius) = make_shape() {
        println!("got circle, radius {}", radius);
    }
}

fn make_shape() -> Shape {
    todo!()
}
```

## Foreshadowing! ðŸ‘»

Two very important enums

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}

enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E)
}
```

We'll come back to them after we learn about error handling.

## Exercise
`describe_shape` should print ``{Shape} with {radius/base/height} {x/y}``.

It should also print ``Large shape detected`` if the shape has a dimension larger than 10.

```rust
enum Shape {
    Circle(i32),
    Rectangle(i32, i32),
    Triangle(i32, i32),
}

fn main() {
    let shapes = [
        Shape::Circle(5),
        Shape::Rectangle(8, 15),
        Shape::Triangle(12, 11),
    ];
    
    for shape in shapes {
        describe_shape(shape);
    }
}
```

## Solution

Possible solution:

```rust
fn describe_shape(shape: Shape) {
    match shape {
        // Handle Circle case
        Shape::Circle(radius) => {
            println!("Circle with radius {}", radius);
            if radius > 10 {
                println!("Large shape detected");
            }
        }

        // Handle Rectangle case
        Shape::Rectangle(width, height) => {
            println!("Rectangle with width {} and height {}", width, height);
            if width > 10 && height > 10 {
                println!("Large shape detected");
            }
        }

        // Handle Triangle case
        Shape::Triangle(base, height) => {
            println!("Triangle with base {} and height {}", base, height);
            if base > 10 && height > 10 {
                println!("Large shape detected");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Error Handling

## There are no exceptions

Rust has two ways of indicating errors:

* Returning a value
* Panicking

## Returning a value

```rust ignore
fn parse_header(data: &str) -> bool {
    if !data.starts_with("HEADER: ") {
        return false;
    }

    true
}
```

It would be nice if we could return *data* as well as *ok, or error*...

## Foretold enums strike back! ðŸ¤¯

Remember these? They are *very important* in Rust.

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}

enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E)
}
```

## I can't find it

If you have an function where one outcome is "can't find it", we use `Option`:

```rust
fn parse_header(data: &str) -> Option<&str> {
    if !data.starts_with("HEADER: ") {
        return None;
    }
    Some(&data[8..])
}
```

Note:

It's so important, it is special-cased within the compiler so you can say `None` instead of `Option::None`, as you would with any other enum.

## That's gone a bit wrong

When the result of a function is *either* __Ok__, or some __Error__ value, we use `Result`:

```rust []
enum MyError {
    BadHeader
}

// Need to describe both the Ok type and the Err type here:
fn parse_header(data: &str) -> Result<&str, MyError> {
    if !data.starts_with("HEADER: ") {
        return Err(MyError::BadHeader);
    }
    Ok(&data[8..])
}
```

Note:

It's so important, it is special-cased within the compiler so you can say `Ok` and `Err` instead of `Result::Ok` and `Result::Err`, as you would with any other enum.

## Handling Results by hand

You can handle `Result` like any other `enum`:

```rust
use std::io::prelude::*;

fn read_file(filename: &str) -> Result<String, std::io::Error> {
    let mut file = match std::fs::File::open("data.txt") {
        Ok(f) => f,
        Err(e) => {
            return Err(e);
        }
    };
    let mut contents = String::new();
    if let Err(e) = file.read_to_string(&mut contents) {
        return Err(e);
    }
    Ok(contents)
}
```

## Handling Results with ?

It is idiomatic Rust to use `?` to handle errors.

```rust
use std::io::prelude::*;

fn read_file(filename: &str) -> Result<String, std::io::Error> {
    let mut file = std::fs::File::open("data.txt")?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
    Ok(contents)
}
```

Note:

This was added in Rust 1.39.

The ? operator will evaluate to the `Ok` value if the `Result` is `Ok`, and it will cause an early return with the error value if it is `Err`. It will also call `.into()` to perform a type conversion if necessary (and if possible).

## What kind of Error?

You can put anything in for the `E` in `Result<T, E>`:

```rust
fn literals() -> Result<(), &'static str> {
    Err("oh no")
}

fn strings() -> Result<(), String> {
    Err(String::from("oh no"))
}

fn enums() -> Result<(), Error> {
    Err(Error::BadThing)
}

enum Error { BadThing, OtherThing }
```

## Using String Literals as the Err Type

Setting `E` to be `&'static str` lets you use `"String literals"`

* It's cheap
* It's expressive
* But you can't change the text to include some specific value
* And your program can't tell what *kind* of error it was

## Using Strings as the Err Type

Setting `E` to be `String` lets you make up text at run-time:

* It's expressive
* You can render some values into the `String`
* But it costs you a heap allocation to store the bytes for the `String`
* And your program still can't tell what *kind* of error it was

## Using enums as the Err Type

An `enum` is ideal to express *one* of a number of different *kinds* of thing:

```rust
/// Represents the ways this module can fail
enum Error {
    /// An error came from the underlying transport
    Io,
    /// During an arithmetic operation a result was produced that could not be stored
    NumericOverflow,
    /// etc
    DiskFull,
    /// etc
    NetworkTimeout,
}
```

## Enum errors with extra context

An `enum` can also hold data for each variant:

```rust
/// Represents the ways this module can fail
enum Error {
    /// An error came from the underlying transport
    Io(std::io::Error),
    /// During an arithmetic operation a result was produced that could not
    /// be stored
    NumericOverflow,
    /// Ran out of disk space
    DiskFull,
    /// Remote system did not respond in time
    NetworkTimeout(std::time::Duration),
}
```

## The std::error::Error trait

* The Standard Library has a `trait` that your `enum Error` should implement
* However, it's not easy to use
* Many people didn't bother
* See <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html>

## Helper Crates

So, people created helper crates like [`thiserror`](https://crates.io/crates/thiserror)

```rust ignore []
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum DataStoreError {
    #[error("data store disconnected")]
    Disconnect(#[from] io::Error),
    #[error("the data for key `{0}` is not available")]
    Redaction(String),
    #[error("invalid header (expected {expected:?}, found {found:?})")]
    InvalidHeader { expected: String, found: String },
    #[error("unknown data store error")]
    Unknown,
}
```

## Something universal

Exhaustively listing all the ways your dependencies can fail is hard.

One solution:

```rust should_panic
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let _f = std::fs::File::open("hello.txt")?; // IO Error
    let _s = std::str::from_utf8(&[0xFF, 0x65])?; // Unicode conversion error
    Ok(())
}
```

## Anyhow

The [`anyhow`](https://crates.io/crates/anyhow) crate gives you a nicer type:

```rust ignore
fn main() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
    let _f = std::fs::File::open("hello.txt")?; // IO Error
    let _s = std::str::from_utf8(&[0xFF, 0x65])?; // Unicode conversion error
    Ok(())
}
```

Note:

* Use `anyhow` if you do not care what error type your function returns, just that it captures something.
* Use `thiserror` if you must design your own error types but want easy `Error` trait impl.

## Panicking

The other way to handle errors is to generate a controlled, program-ending, failure.

* You can `panic!("x too large ({})", x);`
* You can call an API that panics on error (like indexing, e.g. `s[99]`)
* You can convert a `Result::Err` into a panic with `.unwrap()` or `.expect("Oh no")`

## Excercise

Write a function that attempts to read and parse a configuration file. If the file is missing or its contents are invalid, the function should return an appropriate error.

```rust
enum ConfigError {
    FileNotFound(io::Error),
    InvalidFormat,
}

fn read_config(filename: &str) -> Result<i32, ConfigError> {
    // Try to read the file
    // useful functions: fs::read_to_string, Result::map_err 
    let contents = !todo!("Read the contents of the file");

    // Try to parse the contents as an integer
    // useful functions: str::parse, Result::map_err
    let number = !todo!("Parse the contents as an integer");

    Ok(number)
}
```

## Solution

```rust
fn read_config(filename: &str) -> Result<i32, ConfigError> {
    // Try to read the file
    let contents = fs::read_to_string(filename)
        .map_err(|e| ConfigError::FileNotFound(e))?;

    // Try to parse the contents as an integer
    let number = contents.trim().parse::<i32>()
        .map_err(|_| ConfigError::InvalidFormat)?;

    Ok(number)
}
```

# Methods and Traits

# Methods

## Methods

* Methods in Rust, are functions in an `impl` block
* They take `self` (or similar) as the first argument (the *method receiver*)
* They can be called with the *method call operator*

## Example

```rust []
struct Square(f64);

impl Square {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 { self.0 * self.0 }
    fn double(&mut self) { self.0 *= 2.0; }
    fn destroy(self) -> f64 { self.0 }
}

fn main() {
    let mut sq = Square(5.0);
   
    sq.double();  // Square::double(&mut sq)
    println!("area is {}", sq.area()); // Square::area(&sq)
    sq.destroy(); // Square::destroy(sq)
}
```

Note:

You can always use the full function-call syntax. That is what the method call operator will be converted into during compilation.

For motivation for something that takes `self`, imagine an embedded device with a `Uart` object that owns two `Pin` objects - one for the Tx pin and one for the Rx pin. Whilst the `Uart` object exists, those pins are in UART mode. But if you destroy the `Uart`, you want to get the pins back so you can re-use them for something else (e.g. as GPIO pins). Equally you could destroy some `HTTPRequest` object and recover the `TCPStream` contained within, so you could use it for WebSocket traffic instead of HTTP traffic.

## Method Receivers

* `&self` means `self: &Self`
* `&mut self` means `self: &mut Self`
* `self` means `self: Self`
* `Self` means whatever type this `impl` block is for

## Method Receivers

* Other, fancier, *method receivers* [are available](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/associated-items.html)!

```rust ignore []
struct Square(f64);

impl Square {
    fn by_value(self: Self) {}
    fn by_ref(self: &Self) {}
    fn by_ref_mut(self: &mut Self) {}
    fn by_box(self: Box<Self>) {}
    fn by_rc(self: Rc<Self>) {}
    fn by_arc(self: Arc<Self>) {}
    fn by_pin(self: Pin<&Self>) {}
    fn explicit_type(self: Arc<Example>) {}
    fn with_lifetime<'a>(self: &'a Self) {}
    fn nested<'a>(self: &mut &'a Arc<Rc<Box<Alias>>>) {}
    fn via_projection(self: <Example as Trait>::Output) {}
}
```

Notes:

This slide is only intended to show that there's lots of complexity behind the curtain, and we're ignoring almost all of it in this course. Come back for Advanced Rust if you want to know more!

## Associated Functions

* You can also just declare functions with no *method receiver*.
* You call these with normal *function call* syntax.
* Typically we provide a function called `new`

```rust []
pub struct Square(f64);

impl Square {
    pub fn new(width: f64) -> Square {
        Square(width)
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Just an associated function - nothing special about `new`
    let sq = Square::new(5.0);
}
```

Note:

Question - can anyone just call `Square(5.0)` instead of `Square::new(5.0)`? Even from another module?

## Associated Constants

`impl` blocks can also have `const` values:

```rust []
pub struct Square(f64);

impl Square {
    const NUMBER_OF_SIDES: u8 = 4;

    pub fn perimeter(&self) -> f64 {
        self.0 * f64::from(Self::NUMBER_OF_SIDES)
    }
}
```

# Traits

## Traits

* A trait is a list of methods and functions that a type must have.
* A trait can provide *default* implementations if desired.

```rust []
trait HasArea {
    /// Get the area, in mÂ².
    fn area_m2(&self) -> f64;

    /// Get the area, in acres.
    fn area_acres(&self) -> f64 {
        self.area_m2() / 4046.86
    }
}
```

## An example

```rust []
trait HasArea {
    fn area_m2(&self) -> f64;
}

struct Square(f64);

impl HasArea for Square {
    fn area_m2(&self) -> f64 {
        self.0 * self.0
    }
}

fn main() {
    let sq = Square(5.0);
    println!("{}", sq.area_m2());
}
```

## Associated Types

A trait can also have some *associated types*, which are type aliases chosen when
the trait is *implemented*.

```rust
trait Iterator {
    type Item;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}

struct MyRange { start: u32, len: u32 }

impl Iterator for MyRange {
    type Item = u32;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        todo!();
    }
}
```

## Rules for Implementing

You can only *implement* a *Trait* for a *Type* if:

* The *Type* was declared in this module, or
* The *Trait* was declared in this module

You can't implement someone else's trait on someone else's type!

Note:

If this was allowed, how would anyone know about it?

## Rules for Using

You can only *use* the trait methods provided by a *Trait* on a *Type* if:

* The trait is in scope
* (e.g. you add `use Trait;` in that module)

## Traits

* The standard library provides lots of traits, such as:
  * [std::cmp::PartialEq] and [std::cmp::Eq]
  * [std::fmt::Debug] and [std::fmt::Display]
  * [std::iter::IntoIterator] and [std::iter::Iterator]
  * [std::convert::From] and [std::convert::Into]

[std::cmp::PartialEq]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialEq.html
[std::cmp::Eq]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Eq.html
[std::fmt::Debug]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html
[std::fmt::Display]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html
[std::iter::IntoIterator]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.IntoIterator.html
[std::iter::Iterator]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html
[std::convert::From]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html
[std::convert::Into]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.Into.html

Note:

We walk the attendees through each of these examples. They are only listed in pairs for the pleasing symmetry - nothing in Rust says they have to come in pairs.

## Sneaky Workarounds

If a trait method uses `&mut self` and you really want it to work on some `&SomeType` reference, you can:

```rust ignore []
impl SomeTrait for &SomeType {
    // ...
}
```

The I/O traits do this.

## Using Traits Statically

* One way to use traits is by using `impl Trait` as a type.
* This is static-typing, and a new function is generated for every actual type passed.
  * Known as *[monomorphisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomorphization)*
* You can also `impl Trait` in the return position.

## Using Traits Statically: Example

```rust []
trait HasArea {
    fn area_m2(&self) -> f64;
}

struct AreaCalculator {
    area_m2: f64
}

impl AreaCalculator {
    // Multiple symbols may be generated by this function
    fn add(&mut self, shape: impl HasArea) {
        self.area_m2 += shape.area_m2();
    }

    fn total(&self) -> impl std::fmt::Display {
        self.area_m2
    }
}
```

Note:

The total function says "I will give you a value you can display (with `println`), but I am not telling you what it is". You can look up "RPIT" (return position impl trait) for the history of this feature. APIT (argument position impl trait) is probably the less useful of the two.

## Using Traits Dynamically

* Rust also supports *trait references*
* The types are given at run-time through a *vtable*
* The reference is now a *wide pointer*

## Using Traits Dynamically: Example

```rust []
trait HasArea {
    fn area_m2(&self) -> f64;
}

struct AreaCalculator {
    area_m2: f64
}

impl AreaCalculator {
    // Only one symbol is generated by this function. The reference contains
    // a pointer to the table, *and* a pointer to a function table.
    fn add(&mut self, shape: &dyn HasArea) {
        self.area_m2 += shape.area_m2();
    }

    fn total(&self) -> &dyn std::fmt::Display {
        &self.area_m2
    }
}
```

Note:

In earlier editions, it was just `&Trait`, [but it was changed to `&dyn Trait`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2113-dyn-trait-syntax.html)

## Which is better?

*Monomorphisation*? Or *Polymorphism*?

## Requiring other Traits

* Traits can also *require* other traits to also be implemented

```rust []
trait Printable: std::fmt::Debug { 
    fn print(&self) {
        println!("I am {:?}", self);
    }
}
```

## Special Traits

* Some traits have no functions (`Copy`, `Send`, `Sync`, etc)
  * But code can require that the trait is implemented
  * More in this in generics!
* Traits can be marked `unsafe`
  * Must use the `unsafe` keyword to implement
  * They're telling you to read the instructions!

## Exercise

Implement the following methods for `Circle`:

- `new(radius: f64) -> Self`: Creates a new `Circle` instance.
- `area(&self) -> f64`: Returns the area of the circle.
- `circumference(&self) -> f64`: Returns the circumference of the circle.

Impl  `HasPerimeter` for `Circle`.

```rust
struct Circle(f64);

trait HasPerimeter {
    fn perimeter(&self) -> f64;
}
```

## Solution

```rust
impl Circle {
    fn new(radius: f64) -> Self {
        Circle(radius)
    }

    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * self.0 * self.0
    }

    fn circumference(&self) -> f64 {
        2.0 * std::f64::consts::PI * self.0
    }
}

impl HasPerimeter for Circle {
    fn perimeter(&self) -> f64 {
        self.circumference()
    }
}
```

# Lifetimes

## Rust Ownership

* Every piece of memory in Rust program has exactly one owner at the time
* Ownership changes ("moves")
  * `fn takes_ownership(data: Data)`
  * `fn producer() -> Data`
  * `let people = [paul, john, emma];`

## Producing owned data

```rust ignore
fn producer() -> String {
    String::new()
}
```

## Producing references?

```rust ignore
fn producer() -> &str {
    // ???
}
```

* `&str` "looks" at some string data. Where can this data come from?

## Local Data

Does this work?

```rust ignore
fn producer() -> &str {
    let s = String::new();
    &s
}
```

## Local Data

No, we can't return a reference to local data...

```text
error[E0515]: cannot return reference to local variable `s`
 --> src/lib.rs:3:5
  |
3 |     &s
  |     ^^ returns a reference to data owned by the current function
```

## Local Data

You will also see:

```text
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 --> src/lib.rs:1:18
  |
1 | fn producer() -> &str {
  |                  ^ expected named lifetime parameter
```

## Static Data

```rust
fn producer() -> &'static str {
    "hello"
}
```

* bytes `h e l l o` are "baked" into your program
* part of *static* memory (not heap or stack)
* a slice pointing to these bytes will always be valid
* **safe** to return from `producer` function

Note:

You didn't need to specify `'static` for the static variable - there's literally no other lifetime that can work here.

How big is a `&'static str`? Do you think the length lives with the string data, or inside the str-reference itself?

(It lives with the reference - so you can take sub-slices)

## Static Data

It doesn't have to be a string literal - any reference to a static is OK.

```rust
static HELLO: [u8; 5] = [0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f];

fn producer() -> &'static str {
    std::str::from_utf8(&HELLO).unwrap()
}
```

## `'static` annotation

* Rust never assumes `'static` for function returns or fields in types
* `&'static T` means this reference to `T` will never become invalid
* `T: 'static` means that "if type `T` has any references inside they should be `'static`"
  * `T` may have no references inside at all!
* string literals are always `&'static str`

---

```rust ignore
fn takes_and_returns(s: &str) -> &str {

}
```

Where can the returned <code>&str</code> come from?

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">can't be local data</li>
    <li class="fragment">is not marked as <code>'static</code></li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Conclusion: must come from <code>s</code>!</strong></li>
</ul>

## Multiple sources

```rust ignore
fn takes_many_and_returns(s1: &str, s2: &str) -> &str {

}
```

Where can the returned <code>&str</code> come from?

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">is not marked as <code>'static</code></li>
    <li class="fragment">should it be <code>s1</code> or <code>s2</code>?</li>
    <li class="fragment"><strong>Ambiguous. Should ask programmer for help!</strong></li>
</ul>

## Tag system

```rust ignore
fn takes_many_and_returns<'a>(s1: &str, s2: &'a str) -> &'a str {

}
```

"Returned `&str` comes from `s2`"

## `'a`

* "Lifetime annotation"
* often called "lifetime" for short, but that's a very bad term
  * every reference has a lifetime
  * annotation doesn't name a lifetime of a reference, but used to tie lifetimes of several references together
  * builds *"can't outlive"* and *"should stay valid for as long as"* relations
* arbitrary names: `'a`, `'b`, `'c`, `'whatever`

## Lifetime annotations in action

```rust ignore
fn first_three_of_each(s1: &str, s2: &str) -> (&str, &str) {
    (&s1[0..3], &s1[0..3])
}

fn main() {
    let amsterdam = format!("AMS Amsterdam");

    let (amsterdam_code, denver_code) = {
        let denver = format!("DEN Denver");
        first_three_of_each(&amsterdam, &denver)
    };

    println!("{} -> {}", amsterdam_code, denver_code);
}
```

## Annotate!

```rust ignore
fn first_three_of_each<'a, 'b>(s1: &'a str, s2: &'b str) -> (&'a str, &'b str) {
    (&s1[0..3], &s1[0..3])
}
```

## Annotations are used to validate function body

"The source you used in code doesn't match the tags"

```text
error: lifetime may not live long enough
 --> src/lib.rs:2:5
  |
1 | fn first_three_of_each<'a, 'b>(s1: &'a str, s2: &'b str) -> (&'a str, &'b str) {
  |                        --  -- lifetime `'b` defined here
  |                        |
  |                        lifetime `'a` defined here
2 |     (&s1[0..3], &s1[0..3])
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ function was supposed to return data with lifetime `'b` but it is returning data with lifetime `'a`
  |
  = help: consider adding the following bound: `'a: 'b`
```

## Annotations are used to validate reference lifetimes at a call site

"Produced reference *can't outlive* the source"

```text
error[E0597]: `denver` does not live long enough
  --> src/main.rs:10:41
   |
8  |     let (amsterdam_code, denver_code) = {
   |          -------------- borrow later used here
9  |         let denver = format!("DEN Denver");
   |             ------ binding `denver` declared here
10 |         first_three_of_each(&amsterdam, &denver)
   |                                         ^^^^^^^ borrowed value does not live long enough
11 |     };
   |     - `denver` dropped here while still borrowed

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0597`.
```

## Lifetime annotations help the compiler help you!

* You give Rust hints
* Rust checks memory access for correctness

```rust
fn first_three_of_each<'a, 'b>(s1: &'a str, s2: &'b str) -> (&'a str, &'b str) {
    (&s1[0..3], &s2[0..3])
}

fn main() {
    let amsterdam = format!("AMS Amsterdam");
    let denver = format!("DEN Denver");

    let (amsterdam_code, denver_code) = {
        first_three_of_each(&amsterdam, &denver)
    };

    println!("{} -> {}", amsterdam_code, denver_code);
}
```

## What if multiple parameters can be sources?

```rust ignore
fn pick_one(s1: &'? str, s2: &'? str) -> &'? str {
    if coin_flip() {
        s1
    } else {
        s2
    }
}
```

## What if multiple parameters can be sources?

```rust ignore
fn pick_one<'a>(s1: &'a str, s2: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if coin_flip() {
        s1
    } else {
        s2
    }
}
```

* returned reference *can't outlive* either `s1` or `s2`
* potentially more restrictive

Note:

This function body does not *force* the two inputs to live for the same amount of time. Variables live for as long as they live and we can't change that here. This just says "I'm going to use the same label for the lifetimes these two references have, so pick whichever is the shorter".

## Example

```rust []
fn coin_flip() -> bool { false }

fn pick_one<'a>(s1: &'a str, s2: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if coin_flip() {
        s1
    } else {
        s2
    }
}

fn main() {
    let a = String::from("a");
    let b = "b";
    let result = pick_one(&a, b);
    // drop(a);
    println!("{}", result);
}
```

## Lifetime annotations for types

```rust ignore
struct Configuration {
    database_url: &str,
}
```

Where does the string data come from?

## Generic lifetime parameter

```rust ignore
struct Configuration<'a> {
    database_url: &'a str,
}
```
<p>&nbsp;<!-- spacer for "run" button --></p>

* An instance of `Configuration` *can't outlive* a string<br> that it refers to via `database_url`.
* The string *can't be dropped<br> while* an instance of `Configuration` *still* refers to it.


## Exercise

```rust
struct LongestStr<'a> {
    value: &'a str,
    length: usize,
}

fn choose_longest(a: &str, b: &str) -> LongestStr {
    // TODO: Implement function logic to find the longest string
}
```


## Solution

```rust
fn choose_longest<'a>(a: &'a str, b: &'a str) -> LongestStr<'a> {
    let longest = if a.len() > b.len() { a } else { b };
    LongestStr { value: longest, length: longest.len() }
}
```


# Imports and Modules

## Namespaces

* A namespace is simply a way to distinguish two things that have the same name.
* It provides a *scope* to the identifiers within it.

## Rust supports namespacing in two ways:

1. Crates for re-usable software libraries
2. Modules for breaking up your crates

## Crates

* A crate is the unit of Rust software suitable for shipping.
* Yes, it's a deliberate pun.
* The Rust Standard Library is a crate.
* Binary Crates and Library Crates

## There's no build file

* Have you noticed that `Cargo.toml` says nothing about which files to compile?
* Cargo starts with `lib.rs` for a library or the relevant `main.rs` for a binary
* It then finds all the *modules*

## Modules

* A module is block of source code within a crate
* It qualifies the names of everything in it
* It has a parent module (or it is the crate root)
* It can have child modules
* The crate is therefore a *tree*

## Standard Library

We've been using modules from the Rust Standard Library...

```rust []
use std::fs;
use std::io::prelude::*;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let mut f = fs::File::create("hello.txt")?;
    f.write(b"hello")?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Note:

* The [`std::fs` module](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/index.html)
* The [`std::io` module](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/index.html)
* The [`std::io::prelude` module](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/prelude/index.html)

Prelude modules, like `std::io::prelude`, usually contain important traits and you usually want to import all of it with a `*` wildcard.

## In-line modules

You can declare a module in-line:

```rust
mod animals {
    pub struct Cat { name: String }

    impl Cat {
        pub fn new(name: &str) -> Cat {
            Cat { name: name.to_owned() }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let c = animals::Cat::new("Mittens");
    // let c = animals::Cat { name: "Mittens".to_string() };
}
```

## Modules in a file

You can also put modules in their own file on disk.

This will load from either `./animals/mod.rs` or `./animals.rs`:

```rust ignore
mod animals;

fn main() {
    let c = animals::Cat::new("Mittens");
    // let c = animals::Cat { name: "Mittens".to_string() };
}
```

## Modules can be nested...

```console
~/probe-run $ tree src
src
â”œâ”€â”€ backtrace
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ mod.rs
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ pp.rs
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ symbolicate.rs
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ unwind.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ canary.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ cli.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ cortexm.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ dep
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ cratesio.rs
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ mod.rs
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ rust_repo.rs
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ rust_std
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ toolchain.rs
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ rust_std.rs
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ rustc.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ elf.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ probe.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ registers.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ stacked.rs
â””â”€â”€ target_info.rs
```

Note:

The choice about `foo.rs` vs `foo/mod.rs` often depends on whether `mod foo`
itself has any child modules.

The example is from the Knurling tool [`probe-run`](https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run).

## What kind of import?

Choosing whether to import the parent module, or each of the types contained within, is something of an art form.

```rust []
use std::fs;
use std::collections::VecDeque;
use std::io::prelude::*;
```

## Standard Library

There's also a more compact syntax for imports.

```rust []
use std::{fs, io::prelude::*};

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let mut f = fs::File::create("hello.txt")?;
    f.write(b"hello")?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## Exercise

Refactor the code by moving each struct and its associated methods into separate modules.
Organize these modules under a root module and decide if any submodules are necessary.
Update main.rs to import and use the refactored modules.

## Solution

Consider the following structure:

```console
src
â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs
â””â”€â”€ shapes
    â”œâ”€â”€ mod.rs
    â”œâ”€â”€ circle.rs
    â”œâ”€â”€ rectangle.rs
    â””â”€â”€ triangle.rs
```

`src/shapes/mod.rs`:

```rust
pub mod circle;
pub mod rectangle;
pub mod triangle;

pub use circle::Circle;
pub use rectangle::Rectangle;
pub use triangle::Triangle;
```

`src/main.rs`:

```rust
mod shapes;

use shapes::{Circle, Rectangle, Triangle};

...
```

# That's it!
